    <h2>These soft, rich aromatic Swedish cardamom buns are the perfect tasty treat. </h2>


<h3>Dough Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup plus 2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 cups plus 2 Tbsp whole milk</li>
    <li>2 packages instant yeast (1/2 oz. per package)</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>5 3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
</ul>

<h4>Make the cardamom bun dough</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter and add milk. Warm the mixture until lukewarm, then add it to the bowl of a stand mixer with dough hook attachment.</li>
    <li>Add yeast to the bowl with the milk and butter mixture, and mix to dissolve. Then add the salt and sugar.</li>
    <li>With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the flour. Once all flour is incorperated, continue to knead for about 10 minutes. The dough should be smooth and pulling away from the side of the bowl.</li>
    <li>Cover the bowl and allow to rsie for 45 minutes to an hour.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Cardamom filling ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>10 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 Tbsp ground cardamom</li>
</ul>
<h4>Make the cardamom filling</h4>
<ol>
    <li>While the dough is rising, make the cardamom filling by simple mixing all the filling ingredients together with a fork until uniform.</li>
    <li>Prepare two large baking sheets and cover in parchment paper.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Shape the cardamom bun dough</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Roll out half the dough into a rectangle on a floured surface. Spread half the filling over one half of the triangle.</li>
    <li>Fold the other half over, give it a bit of a roll with the rolling pin to even everything out. Slice the rectangle into 8 equal narrow strips.</li>
    <li>Take each strip and use a pizza cutter or knife to cut it lengthwise</li>
    <li>Take each "leg" and twist it gently, both in the same direction.</li>
    <li>Twist the two "legs" around each other.</li>
    <li>Coil the twisted dough into a round shape, tucking the end underneath and pinching it slightly to keep it from unravelling. Each one will be a little different.</li>
    <li>Repeat for the rest of your rectangles.</li>
    <li>Place rolls on prepared baking sheets, spacing a few inches apart. Cover loosely with a kitchen towel and allow to rise again for about <strong>1 hour.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h4>Bake the cardamom buns</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425F.</li>
    <li>Bake for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Make glaze by adding 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan and heating until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and stir 1/2 tsp  of vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Once buns are done baking, remove from the oven and brush them with the glaze while still warm.</li>
    <li>You can add a second coat of the glaze once buns are cooled down. Enjoy!</li>
